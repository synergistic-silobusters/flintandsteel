# flintandsteel

![Rok-Starter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YashdalfTheGray/flintandsteel/master/src/assets/InnovationChallengeLogo.png)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

The following applications need to be installed:

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - this project tests against v5.6.0
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/)
* A text editor like [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)

**NOTE**: [Make sure your node version is compliant!](https://github.com/YashdalfTheGray/flintandsteel/wiki#checking-for-the-right-version-of-node-and-npm)

Make sure that the directories containing `node`, `npm`, `mongod` and `mongo` are added to the path making them accessible from the terminal.

**For Linux Users (Commands are likely CentOS specific):**

* Install bzip2 to extract the contents of phantomjs (`sudo yum install bzip2`)
* Install phantomjs globally (`npm install -g phantomjs`)
* Add the phantomjs bin to your env vars:
  * `export PHANTOMJS_BIN=/usr/local/lib/node_modules/phantomjs/lib/phantom/bin/phantomjs`
  * More permanently, add that line to the .bash_profile file in your $HOME directory.
* Install libfontconfig:
  * `sudo yum install freetype`
  * `sudo yum install fontconfig`
* Add the port you'll be hosting to the firwall rules (`sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8080/tcp`)
  * If you are going to be running production, Add these two instead:
    * `sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http`
    * `sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https`
  * For both dev and prod you must run this command next:
    * `sudo systemctl reload firewalld`

### Get the code

After cloning the git repository run `npm install` from a terminal window. If this process fails complaining about bower, you will need to run `npm install bower -g`, then run `npm install` again. If you receive another error involving Git, then you will need to ensure that Git is installed and the `*\Git\bin` directory is added to your PATH.

You will likely also have to run `npm install gulp -g` in order to run gulp. This command installs `gulp` globally so it can be used in the command line.

**Note**: On UNIX based platforms, this will need to be run with `sudo` and on Windows, the command prompt will require administrative privileges.

### Updating

`gulp clean:modules` will make sure that all the modules are the latest versions and ascertain that there are no unneeded modules downloaded. This clears out both npm and bower modules.

This will reduce the amount of conflicts rising from versioning and previous experiments.

## Running

To run the website server, you must open two terminal windows. In the first window, execute `gulp mongo:start` and leave this window open. This starts the mongo server. In the other window, execute `gulp start:dev` or `gulp start:prod`. Then navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

Running the server in development mode disables LDAP login and HTTPS and falls back to hard-coded credentials. These hard-coded credentials are as follows:
* Guybrush Threepwood (username: test1) (password: test)
* Rick Sanchez (username: test2) (password: test)
* Dick Dickerson (username: test3) (password: test)

In order to run the server in production mode, you need to have access to the company network for LDAP purposes. You also need to create  `server\secrets\ldapAuth.js` which will hold the credentials needed to bind to the LDAP server. Lastly, you will need to have certificates to run HTTPS. Please look up self-signed certificates in order to properly set up the production environment, or obtain certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority.

Any changes to the back-end server code while the server is running will result in a server restart. However, this **DOES NOT** automatically re-run client tests or JavaScript analysis commands, so be sure to run them yourself before submitting a PR.

Any changes to the front-end client code will not result in a server restart. You will, however, need to perform a hard-refresh in your browser window to pick up the changes.

`gulp start:test` will run the server in the test environment. This is identical to `dev`, but it uses a hard-coded port number of `7357` and does not generate data.

### Testing

To run the client side tests, execute `gulp test:client` from a terminal window. This automatically runs when a `gulp start:dev` or `gulp start:prod` command is executed.

To run the server load tests, execute `gulp start:test` from a terminal window then open an additional terminal window and enter `gulp test:load`. This will submit a number of ideas to the server and provide timing statistics in milliseconds to the terminal window.

### Linting and style check

Running `gulp jshint` will lint any JavaScript file under the `src` folder (excluding `src/lib`), the `server` folder and `gulpfile.js`. Running `gulp jscs` will check the code style for the aforementioned files.

Running `gulp code-check` will run both of these commands. 

Unlike `gulp test:client`, these commands do not automatically run when executing a `gulp start:dev` or `gulp start:prod`

### Clearing persistent storage

The express server app uses [mongodb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb) to store users and ideas. There are two databases, `flintandsteel` for production and `flintandsteel-dev` for development. If the development database gets messy, `gulp clean:db-dev` can be used to drop the database.

At this point in time `gulp clean:db-dev` runs automatically when calling `gulp generate:data`, which runs automatically when executing `gulp start:dev`.

### Generating canned data for development database

To start with some predefined data, `gulp generate:data` clears the development database (using `gulp clean:db-dev`) and populates the database with pre-populated ideas and users. This happens automatically if you run `gulp start:dev`.
